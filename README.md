## ScoutUp: Precision Scouting tool
ScoutUp is a quick pipeline to reveal zones in a field that are not visible to the human eye though machine learning. The user can use statelite data for their own lands and analyze it using this pipeline to identify different regions. This could be used as a guided scouting tool for soil sampling to make sure different regions of soil are sampled and to identify potential scouting areas.
